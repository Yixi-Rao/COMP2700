1
- An explanation of the vulnerabilities you discovered and
- how you discovered them.

This is where you document your analysis of the problem (e.g., code analysis, system exploration, etc) 
The tests you've done to confirm your hypotheses about the cause of vulnerabilities.

2
-  Your attack strategy. Having discovered the vulnerabilities, how do you plan to obtain the flag?

Describe the overall strategy,
and the reasoning behind it, e.g., why do you think that particular strategy would work? 
Then map it to the concrete steps
you need to do and how they translate into your exploit code.
